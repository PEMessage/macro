  <h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
  <p>
  <code>macro</code> was written to solve a simple problem: the Java Debugger
   (jdb) is such an excellent tool but doesn't support single-letter commands or
   command repetition (pressing the ENTER key to repeat the last command).</p>

  <p><code>macro</code> can be used as a front end to any interactive command line
  program (the target program) which reads from standard input.
	<code>macro</code> provides an alias substitution mechanism on the first word of the input line.
  The subsituted line is sent to the standard input of the target program.</p>

  <p>By default, <code>macro</code> supports command repetition whereby
  if you input a blank line (press ENTER and nothing else), the last
  line that was sent to the target program is resent.</p>

  <h3><a name="using">Using macro</a></h3>
  <p><code>macro</code> is invoked as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>
  <pre>
Usage: macro [-rv] PROGRAM ARGS...
Where: -r Turn off ENTER key repeats last command
       -v Verbose output (debugging aid)
</pre>
	</blockquote>
<p>
The -r option will turn off command repetition for
target programs that already support this feature or
when you just don't want this behavior.</p>

<p>The -v option may be useful if you are trying to use <code>macro</code>
with a progam other than <code>jdb</code> and it doesn't seem to work.
The most likely cause of failure will be programs that insist that standard
input be a terminal (by calling something like <code>isatty()</code>).</p>


  <p>The following <code>macro</code> commands are not forwarded to the
	target program:</p>
	<blockquote>
  <dl>
      <dt>alias</dt>
      <dd>List all defined aliases.</dd><br />

      <dt>alias NAME=SUBSTITUTION</dt>
      <dd>Define the alias <code>NAME</code> to mean <code>SUBSTITUTION</code>
	(which can be any string).<br />
	Unlike the Linux shell, quotation marks are not used when defining an alias
	unless you want them to be part of the alias.<br />
      	The <code>=</code> sign is required.</dd><br />

      <dt>unalias NAME</dt>
      <dd>Remove the alias <code>NAME</code>.</dd>
  </dl>
	</blockquote>

  <p>When <code>macro</code> starts running, it reads and executes the
  contents of "macro.ini" in the current directory as if
  you had typed the lines yourself. This is the fastest
  way to define a set of aliases to use with the target
  program. Any lines that do not contain a <code>macro</code> command
  are passed onto the target program. Lines that start with a <code>#</code>
  are comments and are ignored.</p>

  <p>The distributed "macro.ini" file is written to be used with <code>jdb</code>
	and defines the following single-letter aliases (note that the <code>alias</code>
	command itself has been given an alias of <code>a</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
alias a=alias
a c=cont
a d=dump
a h=help
a n=next
a p=print
a q=quit
a r=run
a s=step
a w=where
</pre>
</blockquote>


  <h3><a name="install">Installing and Compiling macro</a></h3>
  <p>
  <code>macro</code> is a "C" program that runs under Linux. Download the source code zip
	file here:</p>
  <blockquote><h4><a href="macro.zip">macro.zip</a></h4>
		  Checksums: <a href="macro.sha256sum">sha256sum</a> |
		  <a href="macro.md5sum">md5sum</a></blockquote>
	<p>
	After you unzip the contents of the zip file to a local directory,
	compile the program by running the following command:</p>
	<blockquote>sh compile.sh</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>The executable will be called <code>macro</code>. Copy this file so that it is in your executable
	path (such as <code>~/bin</code> or <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, etc.).</p>

  <h3><a name="debug">Debugging a Java Program with macro</a></h3>
  <p>
	Whether the program you want to debug is a command line program (which will be reading
	from and writing to the console) or not, it is usually easiest to run your program
	in one terminal window and <code>jdb</code> in another.</p>

	<p>The following command will prepare your program for debugging without actually running it:
	<blockquote><pre>java -Xmx100m -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8008,server=y,suspend=y CLASS_NAME $@</pre></blockquote>

	<p>Where <code>CLASS_NAME</code> is the name of the Java Class with <code>main()</code>. The <code>suspend=y</code> option tells Java to not run the program just yet.</p>

	<p>In a separate window, start the Java debugger as follows:</p>
	<blockquote><pre>macro jdb -sourcepath SOURCE_DIR -attach localhost:8008</pre></blockquote>

	<p>Where <code>SOURCE_DIR</code> is the directory where your source code is located.
	The <code>-sourcepath</code> option is only necessary if you are using package names and
	your current directory isn't the top-level package directory.</p>

	<p>Make sure you copy the file "macro.ini" from the <code>macro</code> installation
	directory to your current directory before you run the <code>macro</code> command.
	Create a <code>jdb.ini</code> file in your current directory if you will be running
	<code>jdb</code> more than once to define your usual breakpoints using <code>stop in</code>
	and <code>stop at</code>.</p>

	<p>Start the program you are debugging with <code>r</code> (run), single step with either <code>s</code>
	(step into) or <code>n</code> (next / step over), print variables with <code>p</code>
	and exit with <code>q</code> (quit).</p>

	<p><b>Tip:</b> It is often easiest to create a temporary Java method in your code called
	<code>debug()</code> and call it from some place in your code where you want the program
	to stop. This way, you don't have to worry about line numbers in your break points. Next,
	set a breakpoint with the <code>jdb</code> command <code>stop in CLASS_NAME.debug</code>.</p>

	<p><b>Tip:</b> The <code>jdb</code> <code>print</code> command calls the <code>toString()</code>
	method of the object being printed. Override the <code>toString()</code> method 
	in your objects to add any custom debugging information you want to see easily when
	debugging your program.</p>
